                            why we sometimes need to store these cookies. 
                            We will also discuss how you can prevent these 
                            files from being saved, however, this can degrade

                            Hopefully this clears things up, and as mentioned earlier, 
                            if there is something that you are not sure about whether 
                            you need it or not, it is usually safer to leave cookies 
                            on if you interact with one of the features 
                            you use on our page. ...
